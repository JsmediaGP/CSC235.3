A PROGRAM TO TEST IF A NUMBER IS A SELF DESCRIBING NUMBER

START
DECLARE _SELF_DESCRIBING_NUMBER AS CHARACTER ARRAY
STORE CHARACTER T IN IT AS 
DECLARE NUMBERARRAY AS CHARACTER ARRAY
DECLARE TESTNUMBER AS CHAR 
DECLARE NUMBER NUMBERLENGTH, NO_OF_TEST AS INTEGER
DECLARE COUNTER AS INTEGER AND STORE VALUE OF ZERO IN IT

ACCEPT NUMBER OF TIMES TO TEST
STORE IT IN NO_OF_TEST
SET A FOR LOOP FROM 1 TO NO_OF_TEST AND INCREMEMNT BY 1
ACCEPT NUMBER TO TEST
STORE IT INTO VARIABLE TESTNUMBER
CHECK FOR THE LENTH OF THE TESTNUMBER
STORE INTO NUMBERLENGTH
SET LOOP BASED ON NUMBERLENGTH
STORE LOOP TESTNUMBER INTO NUMBERARRAY LOOP
DISPLAY NUMBERS IN NUMBERARRAY AND THE LOCATION THEY FALL TO IN THE GIVEN NUMBER TO TEST
SET A LOOP OF M BASED ON NUMBERLENGTH AND INCREMENT BY 1 AFTER COMPLETION OF EACH ITERATION
SET A LOOP OF I BASED ON NUMBERLENGTH AND INCREMENT BY 1 AFTER COMPLETION OF EACH ITERATION
CHECK IF NUMBERARRAY OF LOOP I IS EQUAL TO M
    IF YES INCREMEMNT COUNTER BY 1
CHECK IF COUNTER IS EQUAL TO NUMBERARRAY OF LOOP M
    IF YES TESTNUMBER IS A SELF DESCRIBING NUMBER
    IF NO TESTNUMBER IS NOT A SELF DESCRIBING NUMBER
