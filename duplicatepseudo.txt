PROGRAM TO DELETE DUPLICATE FILE

START

DECLARE FILENAME AS CHARACTER ARRAY
DECLARE FILE_ID AS INTEGER ARRAY
DECLARE COMP AS INTEGER WITH ZERO VALUE
DECLARE LVALUE AS INTEGER WITH ZERO VALUE
DECLARE STEPS, FILENUMBER AND TEMP AS INTEGER

ACCEPT NUMBERS OF STEPS
STORE IT IN STEPS
SET A FOR LOOP TO COUNT FROM 0 TO STEPS-1
ACCEPT NUMBER OF FILE TO COMPARE 
STORE IT IN FILENUMBER
DECLARE J AS INTEGER WITH ZERO INTEGER
SET A WHILE LOOP J WHICH IS LESS THAN FILENUMBER
ACCEPT FILENAME AND FILEID 
STORE IT IN FILENAME OF LOOP J AND FILE_ID OF LOOP J RESPECTIVELY
INCREMENT J BY 1
STORE FILE_ID TO LVALUE
DISPLAY FILENAMES AND FILE ID THAT USER SUPPLIED
SET FOR LOOP OF J LESS THAN FILENUMBER
SET FOR LOOP OF I WHICH IS EQUAL TO J + 1 AND WHEN I IS LESS THAN FILENUMBER
COMPARE FILENAME OF LOOP J AMD I
STORE IT IN COMP
CHECK IF COMP IS EQUAL TO ZERO AND LVALUE IS GREATER THAN FILE_ID OF LOOP J
STORE FILE_ID OF LOOP J INTO LVALUE
CHECK IF COMP IS NOT EQUAL TO ZERO AND FILE_ID OF LOOP J IS GREATER THAN FILE_ID OF LOOP I 
STORE FILE_ID OF LOOP J TO T 
STORE FILE_ID OF LOOP I TO FILE_ID OF LOOP J 
STORE T TO FILE_ID OF LOOP I 
SET FOR LOOP FROM ZERO TO FILENUMBER-1
CHECK IF COMP IS NOT EQUAL TO ZERO 
DISPLAY FILE_ID OF LOOP J 
CHECK IF COMP IS EQUAL TO ZERO 
DISPLAY THE FILENAME AND ID THAT WON'T BE DELETED
